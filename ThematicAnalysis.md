## When to use​
To analyse qualitative data generated through interviews, recordings, focus groups etc.​

## How we do it​
Get familiar with the data​
Read transcripts, listen to recordings, watch videos. ​

## Code the observations​
Highlight stories, behaviours, pain points, needs and goals, and assign memorable codes to them.​

## Look for patterns​
Starting with the most insightful or unusual findings, cluster similar findings from different participants.​

## Look for insights​
Dig deeper into the clusters. Good insights are often intuitive and non-obvious.
