# Card Sorting

Card Sorting is a method to used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site.

## Information Architecture
IA focuses on organising, structuring and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way.

## Main components of Information Architecture:
- How you categorise and structure information.
- How you represent information.
- How users browse of move through information.
- How users look for information.

### Why card sort?
- Helps you know how to build the structure of your website.
- decide what to put on the homepage
- label categories and navigation

## Open and closed card sorting:

### Open Card Sort:
- participants are asked to organise topics from content within yur website into groups that make sense to them and then name each group they created in a way that they feel 
- use an open card sort to learn how users group content and the terms or labels they give each category.

### Closed Card Sort:
- particpants are asked to sort topics from content within your website into pre-defined categories.
- works best when you already have a set of pre-defined categories.

## Technique
- One on One: researcher an participant, participant think aloud.
- Group/Independent: participant works alone for most of session, researcher briefs group at beginning and end.
- Group: concurrent in person sessions have participants sort a set of cards as a group, researcher speaks at end and beginning.Group dynamics may effect this.
- Remote: computer-based sessions mean participants sort cards independently. You may not be able to tell why participants are sorting the cards the way that they are. What if it was like user testing and you videoed it as well?

## Best practices for card sorts
- Limit number of cards - in an open sort this means 30 or 40 at most
- Randomise the order of presentation
- Provide participants with an estimate of how long the card sort will take
- Open sort for part 1 and closed sort as part 2 

Much of the value from card sorting comes from listening to the users' comments as they sort the cards: knowing why people place certain cards together gives deeper insight into their mental models than the pure fact that they sorted cards into the same pile.
